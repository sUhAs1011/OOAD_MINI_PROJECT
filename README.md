# OOAD_MINI_PROJECT

My sixth semester OOAD(Object Oriented Analysis And Design) mini-project in Java Programming language using Objected Oriented Concepts and MVC architecture. MVC is basically Model-View-Controller, which is basically a design pattern used in software development and helps in making applications more scalable, organizable and maintainable.

Coming to our project we have implemented personal electronic voting system using MVC architecture and we have broadly classified the project into 4 major modules:

### Module 1: User Authentication Module
- Handles voter registration, login, and identity verification.
- Ensures only authorized users can access the system.
- Implements security features like password hashing, OTP (One-Time Password), or biometric verification.

### Module 2:Voting Interface Module
- Provides a user-friendly interface for voters to cast their votes.
- Displays the list of candidates or options and records the voterâ€™s choice.
- Includes input validation to prevent errors or duplicate submissions.

### Module 3: Vote Management and Results Module
- Manages storage of votes in a secure and tamper-proof manner (e.g., using databases with encryption).
- Includes logic to tally votes and generate results in real-time or after polling concludes.
- Implements result visualization, like graphs or charts, for better clarity.

### Module 4:Audit and Security Module
- Logs all system activities for transparency and accountability.
- Enables system administrators to monitor and detect any unauthorized access or tampering.
- Includes features for auditing votes and ensuring the integrity of the voting process.
